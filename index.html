            <p>
                My name is Alissa and I am originally from California, currently living in the Philadelphia area. I have
                a bachelor’s in Human Biology from Brown University and went on to become a medical student, but with
                more clinical rotations I did not see myself in that lifestyle and wanted to figure out a different life
                for myself. I began learning how to code on my own under a year ago, and I hope to get into a career
                where there is room for growth, and in which I can make a comfortable living applying my skills and
                creativity. I’m excited to enter this field—there are so many possibilities! My favourite pastimes are
                cooking and baking but I took that a step further and have my current job as a line cook/pastry chef.
                Other facts about me: I love all dogs, and my favorite genres of music are electro swing and bollywood.
